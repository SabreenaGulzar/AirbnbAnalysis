# AirbnbAnalysis
Objective: The project aims to analyze Airbnb data to uncover insights related to pricing, availability, and location. The key tasks include data cleaning, preparation, visualization, and building an interactive web application and dashboard.

1. Data Retrieval and Preparation:

Data Source: The project uses an Airbnb dataset, which is retrieved from a MongoDB database.
Data Cleaning: Tasks include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring correct data types. This is crucial for accurate analysis and visualization.
2. Data Analysis:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze various aspects of the data, such as:
Pricing Variations: Study how prices vary by location, property type, and seasons.
Availability Patterns: Analyze occupancy rates and how they change across different times of the year.
Location-Based Insights: Investigate trends and patterns based on geographic regions or neighborhoods.
3. Visualization:

Interactive Maps: Use tools like Plotly and Streamlit to create maps showing the distribution of Airbnb listings. These maps allow users to explore different aspects such as prices and ratings interactively.
Dynamic Plots: Develop plots and charts to visualize data trends, such as price variations and availability patterns.
4. Web Application Development:

Streamlit Application: Build a Streamlit app that provides an interactive interface for users to explore the Airbnb data. Features include:
Data Upload: Allow users to upload their own datasets.
Filtering Options: Users can filter data by neighborhood, property type, and other factors.
Visualization: Display interactive charts and maps based on the filtered data.
5. Dashboard Creation:

Power BI or Tableau: Create a comprehensive dashboard to present key insights from the analysis. This dashboard integrates various visualizations and provides an overview of the data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
6. Key Features of the Project:

User Interaction: The Streamlit app and dashboard enable users to interact with the data and visualize different aspects.
Data Insights: The project uncovers valuable insights into pricing trends, availability patterns, and location-based data.
Visualization Tools: Utilize advanced visualization tools to present data in a user-friendly and informative manner.
Overall, this project leverages data science techniques and tools to analyze Airbnb data, providing actionable insights and interactive features to explore the dataset comprehensively.
